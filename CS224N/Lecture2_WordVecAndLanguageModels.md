## 🔧 Optimization Review

* We have a loss function $(J(\theta))$ . To minimize it, we compute the **gradient** $(\nabla J)$ , pick a small step size (learning rate $(\alpha))$ , and update:

$$
  [
  \theta \leftarrow \theta - \alpha \nabla J(\theta)
  ]
$$

* **Gradient descent** (batch) uses the full training set to compute (\nabla J) at every update — expensive if dataset is large.

* **Stochastic gradient descent** (or mini‑batch gradient descent) picks a small random subset (e.g. 16, 32, or 64 examples), estimates the gradient using that subset, and updates.

  * It’s noisier, but much faster.
  * In practice, the noise can help escape shallow local minima or plateaus in the landscape of neural networks.

## 🧠 Word Vectors & Word2Vec

### Basic idea

* Each word $( w )$ is associated with two vectors (for “center word” and “outside word”) — typically initialized randomly (small values).
* Given a center word, the model tries to predict its context words (skip-gram) by dot products between word vectors, passing them through a softmax to get predicted probabilities.
* The discrepancy between predictions and actual context words gives a loss; gradients of that loss are used to update the vectors.

### Why two vectors per word?

* Using separate vectors for "center" and "outside" simplifies the mathematics (avoids quadratic terms when a word appears both as center and outside in the same context).
* In practice, people sometimes average the two vectors after training to get a single vector representation.

### Negative Sampling

* Softmax requires summing over the entire vocabulary (which is huge), making computation expensive.
* **Negative sampling** is a simplification: for a given positive (center, context) pair, sample a small number (e.g. 5 or 10) of “negative” words (not in the context).
* Use the logistic (sigmoid) function $(\sigma(x) = 1 / (1 + e^{-x}))$ .
* Encourage high (\sigma(\mathbf{v}*{center} \cdot \mathbf{v}*{outside})) for true pairs, and low (\sigma(\cdot)) for negative pairs.
* The negative words are sampled from a modified unigram distribution (often raising frequencies to the 3/4 power).

---

## 📊 Count-Based & Factorization Alternatives

* A straightforward approach: build a **co-occurrence matrix** ( C ) of size $( V \times V )$ , where ( C_{ij} ) is how often word ( j ) appears in the context of word ( i ).

* But $( V \times V )$ is huge (e.g. 400,000 × 400,000), so this is impractical as is.

* Use **dimensionality reduction** (e.g. PCA or Singular Value Decomposition, SVD) to reduce the matrix to lower-dimensional representations.

* Earlier work (e.g. LSA) used this approach.

* GloVe (Global Vectors) is an approach that blends the strengths of count-based and predictive models: it models (\log) of co-occurrence counts or ratios of co-occurrence probabilities using word vectors and biases, aiming for linear relationships in the vector space.

---

## ✅ Evaluation of Word Vectors

### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic

* **Intrinsic evaluation**: directly evaluate the embeddings on small linguistic tasks, e.g. analogies, word similarity datasets.
* **Extrinsic evaluation**: embed words and then test performance on a downstream task (e.g. Named Entity Recognition, part-of-speech tagging, machine translation) — more realistic, but more work.

### Intrinsic methods used

* **Analogies**: “man : king :: woman : ?” → should return “queen”
* **Word similarity judgments**: human annotators score pairs of words (e.g. “car” and “automobile”) on how similar they think they are. Compare model cosine similarity to human scores (correlation).

---

## 🧬 Word Senses and Ambiguity

* Many words are **polysemous** — multiple senses (e.g. “bank” = financial institution vs riverbank).
* One approach: represent each sense separately — cluster word occurrences by context and learn separate vector for each sense.
* But the more common modern approach: learn a **single vector per word**, which is a weighted average (superposition) over senses.
* Interestingly, via **sparse coding** or related techniques, one can sometimes *recover* sense-level vectors from the single vector in high-dimensional spaces.

---

## 🧮 Neural Classifiers & Basic Neural Network Intuition

### Motivation

* Traditional classifiers (logistic regression, SVM, etc.) are **linear** in the input features.
* A neural classifier can learn **representations** of the input (via hidden layers) that make classification easier (i.e. nonlinear decision boundaries in the original space).

### Setup for a small neural network classifier

* Input: a window of words (e.g. 5 words), convert each word to its vector, and **concatenate** those vectors into one long input vector.
* Hidden layer: apply an affine transformation (weight matrix + bias) + nonlinearity (e.g. logistic, ReLU).
* Output layer: linear score → apply logistic (for binary classification) or softmax (for multiple classes).
* When trained end-to-end, both the word embeddings and the classifier weights get adjusted, so the whole model “learns” meaningful features.

### Connections to logistic regression

* A single neuron + logistic = logistic regression.
* Neural networks stack many such “neurons” (units) in layers.
* The hidden layers allow the model to transform input into representations better suited for the final linear classification.

---

## 🔍 Cross-Entropy Loss (Preview for PyTorch Assignment)

* **Cross-entropy** is a loss function from information theory. If (p) is the true distribution and (q) is the predicted distribution, the cross-entropy is:

$$
  [
  H(p, q) = - \sum_i p_i \log q_i
  ]
$$

* In classification with “one-hot” true labels (y), only the term corresponding to the correct class remains, giving:

  [
  * $\log q_{y}$
  ]


* In PyTorch, you'll typically use **`CrossEntropyLoss`**, which combines the log-softmax + negative log likelihood internally.

---

## 🧠 Biological Inspiration (Brief)

* The concept of a **neuron**: many inputs converge, processed in the cell body; if activation is strong enough, output is generated (axon).
* Artificial neural networks loosely mimic this: weighted sum of inputs → nonlinearity → output.
* The networks build complexity by stacking layers of such “neurons.”

## 🧪 Short-Answer Quiz

> **Instructions**: Answer each question in 2–3 sentences using concepts from the lecture.

1. **What is the core difference between standard Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and why is SGD preferred for training neural networks?**
   Standard Gradient Descent computes gradients using the full dataset, which is computationally expensive. SGD uses mini-batches, allowing faster updates and introducing noise that can help escape local minima.

2. **Why are two sets of vectors used for each word in Word2Vec?**
   Using separate center (`v`) and outside (`u`) vectors avoids quadratic terms during optimization and simplifies calculations. These vectors are often averaged post-training.

3. **Describe "analogies" in Word2Vec.**
   Word2Vec captures semantic relationships as vector operations, such as:
   `vector(King) - vector(man) + vector(woman) ≈ vector(Queen)`.

4. **What is the computational challenge of softmax, and how does negative sampling help?**
   Softmax requires computing a sum over the full vocabulary. Negative sampling simplifies this by training the model to distinguish real context words from a few negative samples.

5. **How do count-based methods differ from predictive models like Word2Vec?**
   Count-based models build a [co-occurrence matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence_matrix) and reduce its dimensionality (e.g., via [SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)). Predictive models like Word2Vec learn vectors directly by predicting context words.

6. **What is GloVe’s central insight?**
   GloVe models ratios of co-occurrence probabilities using word vectors. It maps the dot product of word vectors to the logarithm of their co-occurrence count.

7. **Define intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation with examples.**
   *Intrinsic:* Evaluate vectors on analogy tasks.
   *Extrinsic:* Use vectors in downstream tasks like [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition).

8. **How do standard models handle polysemy?**
   They assign a single vector per word, representing a weighted average of all senses.

9. **What is a key advantage of neural classifiers over logistic regression?**
   Neural classifiers learn both the representation (e.g., word vectors) and classifier, allowing nonlinear boundaries and improved performance.

10. **Relationship between cross-entropy loss and negative log-likelihood?**
    In supervised learning, [cross-entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy) simplifies to the [negative log-likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function) of the correct class.

# 📘 Word Embeddings and the Word2Vec Model

**Word embeddings**, also known as **word vectors**, are essential tools in [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). They represent words as vectors of real numbers and capture both the semantics and relationships between words. Remarkably, these semantic properties arise from relatively simple mathematical processes applied over large textual datasets.

---

## 🔍 Learning Mechanism: Word2Vec

### 🚀 Initialization and Objective

* Each word starts with a randomly initialized vector (small values).
* Zero initialization is avoided due to the risk of creating **false symmetries**, which hinder learning.
* The **Skip-gram** model (a Word2Vec variant) aims to predict surrounding context words from a given center word.

### ⚙️ Bag-of-Words Assumption

* The Skip-gram model is **order-agnostic** — it does not distinguish between left and right context.
* This makes it a **[bag-of-words model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)**.

---

## 🔧 Optimization: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

* **[Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)** minimizes the objective (loss) function by stepping in the direction of the negative gradient.
* **[Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent)** uses a small **mini-batch** (e.g., 16–32 samples) to estimate the gradient:

$$
  [
  \theta \leftarrow \theta - \alpha \nabla J(\theta)
  ]
$$

  * Noisy updates help escape shallow local minima.
  * Much faster and better suited to neural networks than full-batch methods.
* **Learning rate $((\alpha))$ .**: Determines the step size during updates.

---

## ⚠️ Training Alternatives: Negative Sampling

* **Problem with Naive Softmax**: Requires summing over the entire vocabulary — computationally expensive.
* **[Negative Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546)**:

  * Trains a binary classifier to distinguish real context words from randomly sampled negative words.
  * Typically uses 5–10 negative samples per update.
  * Sampling uses a modified [unigram distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unigram_language_model):

$$
    [
    P(w) \propto (\text{frequency}(w))^{3/4}
    ]
$$

---

## 🧠 Semantic Properties of Word Vectors

### 🔁 Similarity

* Similar words (e.g., *USA*, *Canada*, *America*) have vectors close together in the embedding space.

### ➕ Linear Semantic Analogies

* Word vectors support **arithmetic analogies**:

$$
  [
  \text{King} - \text{Man} + \text{Woman} \approx \text{Queen}
  ]
$$

* Vector differences capture relationships (e.g., gender, royalty, geography).
* Embeddings encode cultural knowledge (e.g., *Russia* → *Vodka*, *Australia* → *Beer*).

---

## 🧮 Count-Based Models and GloVe

### 📊 Co-occurrence Matrix

* A **[co-occurrence matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence_matrix)** tallies how often word (j) appears in the context of word (i).
* These matrices can be enormous (e.g., 400,000 × 400,000).

### 🔻 Dimensionality Reduction

* Use **[Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)** to create compact, low-dimensional embeddings.

### 🌐 GloVe: Global Vectors

* Developed to combine count-based statistics with the semantic linearity seen in Word2Vec.
* Core insight: **ratios of co-occurrence probabilities** encode meaning.
* GloVe uses a **log-bilinear model**:

$$
  [
  \mathbf{v}*i^\top \mathbf{v}*j + b_i + b_j \approx \log(X*{ij})
  ]
$$

  where $(X*{ij})$ is the co-occurrence count.
* Captures linear meaning components and analogies.

---

## 🌀 Word Sense and Polysemy

* Words like *pike* have multiple meanings (fish, weapon, road).
* **Standard models** learn one vector per word — a **superposition** of all senses.

  * This is a **weighted average** based on frequency in the corpus.
* Discrete sense modeling (e.g., *Jaguar 1* vs *Jaguar 4*) is rare due to the fluidity of language.

### 🔍 Sparse Coding to the Rescue

* **[Sparse coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_coding)** techniques can sometimes decompose the superposition into distinct sense vectors, leveraging high-dimensional sparsity.

---

## 🧪 Evaluation of Word Embeddings

### 🧠 Intrinsic Evaluation

* Tests embeddings on narrow subtasks:

  * **Analogies**: E.g., *King* - *Man* + *Woman* = ?
  * **Word similarity**: Compare cosine similarities to human judgments.

### 🏗️ Extrinsic Evaluation

* Measures performance on downstream NLP tasks like:

  * [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition)
  * Question answering, summarization, etc.
* Often the **best indicator** of embedding usefulness in real-world applications.

# 📘 Word Embeddings and the Word2Vec Model

**Word embeddings**, or **word vectors**, are dense, real-numbered representations of words that encode **semantic meaning** and **relational structure**. These vectors are learned using relatively simple mathematical techniques applied over large textual corpora, enabling models to exhibit a surprising degree of **semantic understanding**.

---

## 🔍 The Word2Vec Algorithm and Its Variants

The **[Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)** algorithm is one of the most influential methods for generating word vectors.

### ⚙️ Initialization and Objective

* Each word is initialized with a random vector of small values (not zeros, to avoid **false symmetries** that prevent learning).
* The **Skip-gram** variant predicts surrounding context words given a center word.

### 🧺 Bag of Words Model

* Word2Vec does **not encode word order or syntax** — only co-occurrence within a context window.
* This makes it a **[bag-of-words model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)**.

---

## 🔧 Optimization: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

* The model minimizes a loss function by adjusting word vectors via **[Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent)**.
* Unlike full-batch gradient descent, **SGD**:

  * Uses small **mini-batches** (e.g., 16–32 examples).
  * Introduces **noise** that can help escape local minima.
* **Learning rate** (\alpha): A small value (e.g., $(10^{-3}) to (10^{-5}))$ controls the step size.

---

## 🚫 Technical Challenges and Negative Sampling

### ❗ Softmax Bottleneck

* **Naive softmax** is computationally expensive: it requires summing over the full vocabulary (e.g., 400,000 words) to compute probabilities.

### ✅ Solution: Negative Sampling

* Replaces softmax with **logistic regression** over:

  1. **True context word** (positive example)
  2. **Randomly sampled negative words** (5–10 per example)

* **Negative sampling distribution**:

$$
  [
  P(w) \propto (\text{frequency}(w))^{3/4}
  ]
$$

  * This increases the likelihood of selecting **less frequent words**, improving performance.

* Word2Vec uses two vector sets:

  * **Center word vectors** and **outside word vectors** (not shared, for simplicity).
  * Often **averaged post-training**.

---

## 🧠 Semantic Properties of Word Vectors

### 🔁 Similarity

* Words with similar meanings cluster in vector space.
  E.g., *USA* ~ *Canada*, *America*, *United States*.

### ➕ Linear Semantic Analogies

* Embeddings support **vector arithmetic**:

$$
  [
  \text{King} - \text{Man} + \text{Woman} \approx \text{Queen}
  ]
$$

* Differences between word vectors capture relationships:

  * *King - Man* → captures concept of **ruler**
  * Cultural examples: *Russia → Vodka*, *Australia → Beer*

---

## 📊 Count-Based Models and GloVe

### 🧮 Co-occurrence Matrix

* Count-based models construct a **[co-occurrence matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence_matrix)**:

  * Entry (C_{ij}): How often word (j) appears in context of word (i)
* The matrix is huge (e.g., 400,000 × 400,000).

### 🔻 Dimensionality Reduction

* Apply **[Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)** or similar techniques to obtain compact vectors.
* Early methods (e.g., **Latent Semantic Analysis**) were improved by:

  * **Log-count scaling**
  * **Ramp windows** (weighting nearby words more heavily)

### 🌐 GloVe: Global Vectors

* Developed to combine **global corpus statistics** with Word2Vec’s linearity.
* Core insight: **Ratios of co-occurrence probabilities** encode meaning.
* Example:

  * Words like *solid* vs. *gas* around *ice* vs. *steam* reveal the **solid/liquid/gas dimension**.
* Uses a **log-bilinear model**:
  [
  \mathbf{v}_i^\top \mathbf{v}*j + b_i + b_j \approx \log(X*{ij})
  ]

  * Ensures vector differences encode **meaningful semantic components**.

## 🔄 Word Sense and Polysemy

* Words like *pike* (fish, weapon, road) have **multiple meanings**.
* Standard practice:

  * Learn **one vector per word** (a **superposition** of senses).
  * Acts as a **weighted average** based on frequency.
* Discrete sense vectors (e.g., *Jaguar 1, Jaguar 4*) are not commonly used in practice.

# 📊 Evaluation of Word Vectors in NLP

Evaluating word vector models and machine learning components in **[Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)** typically involves two main strategies:

* **Intrinsic Evaluation**: Focuses on internal subtasks.
* **Extrinsic Evaluation**: Assesses performance in real-world applications.

---

## 🧪 Intrinsic Evaluation

**Intrinsic evaluation** measures how well a model performs on **specific, well-defined internal tasks**. These tasks are:

* Quick to compute.
* Useful for model diagnostics.
* Sometimes loosely correlated with real-world success.

### 🔗 1. Word Vector Analogies

* Tests the model's ability to solve analogy questions like:

$$
  [
  \text{King} - \text{Man} + \text{Woman} \approx \text{Queen}
  ]
$$

* The task: Identify the word vector **closest** (by cosine similarity) to the result of this operation.
* Evaluation: Measures the **percentage of correct answers** on a set of analogy problems.
* Assesses:

  * Ability to capture **linear semantic relationships**.
  * Encoded **cultural or world knowledge** (e.g., *Australia → Beer*, *Russia → Vodka*).

### 🔗 2. Word Similarity

* Compares model-generated similarity scores to **human judgments**.
* Process:

  1. Collect human similarity ratings for word pairs (e.g., *plane* vs. *car*) on a scale (e.g., 0–10).
  2. Compute cosine similarity between word vectors.
  3. Measure **correlation** (typically Spearman or Pearson) between the model’s scores and human ratings.
* Used to compare algorithms like:

  * **[SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)** on log-count matrices.
  * **[Skip-gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)** (Word2Vec).
  * **[GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)**.

> 🔹 *Strength*: Fast, interpretable results.
> 🔸 *Limitation*: May not reflect performance in practical systems.

---

## 🛠️ Extrinsic Evaluation

**Extrinsic evaluation** tests a model’s **real-world utility** by embedding it into **full-scale downstream applications**. It assesses:

* End-to-end system performance.
* Practical impact of model improvements.

### 🧩 Common Downstream Tasks

* **[Named Entity Recognition (NER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition)**
* **Question answering**
* **Document summarization**
* **[Machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation)**
* **Web search** (e.g., equating *cell phone* and *mobile phone*)

### 🧠 Named Entity Recognition Example

* Task: Identify and classify named entities in text.

  * *"Chris Manning"* → **Person**
  * *"Palo Alto"* → **Location**
* Adding word vectors (e.g., GloVe) to traditional symbolic/probabilistic models:

  * Boosts classification accuracy.
  * Demonstrates **practical benefits** of learned embeddings.

> 🔹 *Strength*: Measures direct impact on real-world tasks.
> 🔸 *Limitation*: Indirect, complex to trace causes of performance changes.

# 🤖 How AI Really Learns Language: Four Bizarrely Simple Ideas That Started a Revolution

## 📌 Introduction: The Surprising Simplicity Behind How AI Understands Language

Advanced AI models like ChatGPT appear to understand and generate language with near-magical fluency. While it might seem that the technology behind such capabilities must be overwhelmingly complex, the **foundational ideas** behind this progress are surprisingly **simple and counter-intuitive**.

In the early 2010s, researchers uncovered elegant techniques that allowed machines to **learn meaning from massive text corpora** using basic statistical principles. This article explores **four revolutionary ideas** that transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) and laid the groundwork for today's language models.

---

## 1. 🧭 *You Are Known by the Company You Keep*

The **[Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)** model showed that a machine can learn a word's meaning by **predicting nearby words** in a large corpus.

* By training on the task of predicting which words appear near a center word, the model builds **word vectors** that locate each word in a **high-dimensional "meaning space"**.
* This results in embeddings that group semantically similar words together:

  * *"Bread"* and *"croissant"*
  * *"Banana"* and *"mango"*

> 💡 Despite no direct definitions or labeled training, the model captures **semantic similarity** using just raw co-occurrence statistics.

---

## 2. ➕ *Word Math: King – Man + Woman = Queen*

Word vectors aren’t just points in space—they encode **relationships** that can be manipulated through **vector arithmetic**.

* Famous analogy:

$$
  [
  \text{King} - \text{Man} + \text{Woman} \approx \text{Queen}
  ]
$$

* This reveals that abstract concepts like **gender** or **royalty** are **directions** in the vector space.
* Other examples:

  * *Australia → Beer* as *France → Champagne*
  * *Pencil → Sketching* as *Camera → Photographing*

> ✨ This demonstrates that word vectors encode **deep structural knowledge** of both **language** and **culture**.

---

## 3. 🔁 *Why 'Good Enough' Is Better Than Perfect*

Most optimization problems aim to compute precise, perfect steps. However, in neural networks, **imperfection** leads to **better learning**.

* Traditional **[Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)** is slow because it uses the full dataset for every update.
* **[Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent)** instead updates parameters using small random samples (**mini-batches**).

> ✅ The noise introduced by mini-batches acts as a **"jiggle"** that helps escape poor local minima and improves generalization.

> 🎯 In practice, **SGD is not only faster but often yields better results** than exact gradient descent.

---

## 4. 🌀 *The Secret Lives of Words*

Many words are **polysemous**—they have multiple meanings.
E.g., *"Jaguar"* = animal 🐆, car 🚗, or Mac OS version 🖥️.

* Standard models create **one vector per word**, which becomes a **weighted average** (or **superposition**) of all meanings.
* This seems to discard individual senses...
  But **[Sparse Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_coding)** reveals something remarkable:

  * In **high-dimensional, sparse spaces**, it is mathematically possible to **reconstruct individual sense vectors** from a single averaged one.

> 🔬 A surprising feat: from one combined vector, **distinct meanings can be recovered** using the structure of the space itself.

---

## 🧠 Conclusion: From Simple Math to Complex Understanding

These four ideas highlight how simple methods, when scaled and combined thoughtfully, create powerful linguistic understanding:

| Key Idea                             | Insight                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **1. Predicting neighbors**          | Builds semantic embeddings from context |
| **2. Word vector arithmetic**        | Captures relationships as directions    |
| **3. Noisy learning is better**      | SGD improves both speed and results     |
| **4. Superpositions can be decoded** | Even polysemy can be unraveled          |

These principles **unlocked the first generation of true machine language understanding**, forming the foundation for systems like ChatGPT.

> 🤔 What other **elegant, surprising truths** might still be waiting to power the **next AI revolution**?
