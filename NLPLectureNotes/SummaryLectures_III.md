## 📖 Text Summarization – Introduction

This lecture introduces **Text Summarization**, the task of producing a **shorter version** of a text while preserving its most important information.

---

## 🌍 What is Text Summarization?

* **Definition:** Automatically generating a concise summary of a document (or set of documents).
* Types:

  1. **Extractive Summarization** → select important sentences/phrases from the original text.
  2. **Abstractive Summarization** → generate new sentences that capture the essence of the text.

📖 [Text Summarization (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization)

---

## 🔑 Examples

### Input:

*"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI concerned with the interaction between computers and human language."*

### Extractive Summary:

*"NLP is a field of AI about computers and human language."*

### Abstractive Summary:

*"NLP studies how computers understand human language."*

---

## ⚙️ Extractive Summarization

* Methods:

  * **Statistical approaches** → word frequency, TF-IDF, sentence scoring.
  * **Graph-based methods** (e.g., TextRank, LexRank).
* Example: Sentence importance determined by centrality in a similarity graph.

📖 [TextRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextRank)

---

## ⚙️ Abstractive Summarization

* Methods:

  * **Seq2Seq models** with attention.
  * **Transformer-based models** (BERTSUM, T5, BART).

📖 [BART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BART_%28language_model%29)

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

1. **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**

   * Measures n-gram overlap with reference summaries.
   * Widely used but favors extractive summaries.

📖 [ROUGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_%28metric%29)

2. **BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore** → used in abstractive summarization.

📖 [BERTScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675)

---

## ⚠️ Challenges in Summarization

1. **Abstractive Generation** → difficult to ensure factual correctness.
2. **Redundancy** → avoiding repetition.
3. **Domain Adaptation** → general models may fail in scientific/medical domains.
4. **Evaluation** → automatic metrics often don’t match human judgment.

---

## 📊 Applications of Summarization

* **Legal & Medical Documents** → condensing long reports.
* **Scientific Articles** → automatic literature review.
* **Meeting/Email Summaries** → productivity tools.

---

## 📌 Summary

* Summarization = **shortening text while preserving meaning**.
* Two types: **Extractive** (select key sentences) and **Abstractive** (generate new ones).
* Approaches: statistical, graph-based, neural (Seq2Seq, Transformers).
* Evaluation: ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore.
* Applications: news, law, medicine, research, productivity.
